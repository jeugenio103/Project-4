4831,10,"Right here, mister"
4832,10,You took up my spoon
4833,10,"Stirring curry, stirring chili"
4834,10,That's when I've realized we've became family
4835,10,Rise and fall
4836,10,Silver moon tide erased my foot prints
4837,10,Then I picked up broken scales
4838,10,Stuck them to my tail
4839,10,"Ah, if love truly makes you blind (Ah)"
4840,10,Then I guess
4841,10,There is no need (There is no need to see)
4842,10,I'll trade my eyes so you can see for me
4843,10,"Lu-la-la, lu-la-li-la"
4844,10,"Stay with me, you will never be sad"
4845,10,"I, I will embrace"
4846,10,"Embrace your bubbles, your fluids, and keep you warm"
4847,10,Then I will squeeze out
4848,10,"Squeeze out your germs, your spore, your viruses"
4849,10,"I, I will embrace"
4850,10,"Embrace your membranes, your bones, and keep you cool"
4851,10,Then I will squeeze out
4852,10,"Squeeze out your evil, your grim, and your woe"
4853,10,Transform myself once and for all
4854,10,"Sink into the tub (Ah, ah)"
4855,10,"Reborn, reform"
4856,10,Twist my legs to one and mind to none
4857,10,"Tell me, tell me what do you see?In the mirror that's covered in chalky steam"
4858,10,"Touch me, touch me, kiss me to sleep"
4859,10,Cut me open and give me gills so I can breathe
4860,10,With tweezers and nippers
4861,10,Trim off my fins and forever I'll be yours
4862,10,"I won't fight or make you cry(La-la, la-la, la-la-la)"
4863,10,"Whatever you need, whenever you need"
4864,10,I'll be by your side
4865,10,And then I gave you my eyes
4866,10,To see all the colours
4867,10,And then I gave you my ears
4868,10,To hear all the sirens
4869,10,And then I gave you my heart
4870,10,To fill in the emptiness in your chest
4871,10,And then I gave you my brain
4872,10,So that you can learn to love (Ah)
4873,10,"(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)"
4874,10,"(This heart beating, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)"
4875,10,"(Look for her books, now christen the art)"
4876,10,"Hey doctor, take my temperature"
4877,10,Think I've got a fever
4878,10,Why doctor you make me feel worse
4879,10,Your touch raises my pressure
4880,10,"Blooms, it blooms, the seed that you left inside"
4881,10,"It blooms, no need for air or sunlight"
4882,10,"It blooms, with my blood it stays alive"
4883,10,My soil is spread
4884,10,Before your eyes
4885,10,Look at me
4886,10,Don't you see
4887,10,Your dahlia has flowered
4888,10,"Blooms, it blooms"
4889,10,"The secret garden serenades, germinates"
4890,10,Florets turn bright red
4891,10,"Lu-li-la, li-la, lu-li-la"
4892,10,Smile at me smile at me endlessly
4893,10,Separate me in half
4894,10,"So the doctor can stitch me back up, up inside"
4895,10,Separate me in half
4896,10,Prosper my dear dahlia
4897,10,"It blooms, it blooms, the dahlia blooms"
4898,10,"It blooms, it blooms, the dahlia withers and droops"
4899,10,"Then blooms, and blooms, forever it blooms"
4900,10,"And dies, and blooms, silently it blooms"
4901,10,Isn't it funny
4902,10,We worship a moon that stole its light from the sun
4903,10,"Hear that?Believers, they speak"
4904,10,"Oink, oink"
4905,10,Like how I was so naive
4906,10,"When will it be my turn, my turn"
4907,10,I'm not just some tragic victim
4908,10,"But when will I learn, will I learn"
4909,10,How many bridges do I have to burn
4910,10,Isn't it pretty
4911,10,"All my life, all my poetry leaving me"
4912,10,And the angels sing surrounding me put me to sleep
4913,10,Then it dawned on me that all I wanted
4914,10,Was an approval that you're never willing to give
4915,10,Hate to admit I've done it all for you
4916,10,"I am a wolf, I'm a crow, I'm a bat a butterfly in disguise"
4917,10,"I'm in the air, in the sea, in the moment, I'm in you"
4918,10,In me
4919,10,"When will it be my turn, my turn"
4920,10,I'm not just some tragic victim
4921,10,"But when will I learn, will I learn"
4922,10,"It's just me in this world, I'm alone, I'm complete"
4923,10,"Still waiting for my turn, my turn"
4924,10,Even though I'm outnumbered
4925,10,"Now, you have me torn, you have me torn"
4926,10,Can't remember who I was before
4927,10,If you think we take too much
4928,10,Then you can sacrifice yourself
4929,10,"Don't push your values, push your values"
4930,10,Onto the crowd
4931,10,The world runs on its kings
4932,10,Its slaves
4933,10,Leaving some with no choice
4934,10,"The hypocrites, they justify"
4935,10,Their very sense of justice
4936,10,I tell myself
4937,10,I'm not like everyone else
4938,10,Believing without doubt
4939,10,Mix it in
4940,10,My vitamins
4941,10,"Oh, mix it in"
4942,10,Ah
4943,10,If you think we eat too much
4944,10,Then you can sacrifice yourself
4945,10,"Don't mix your garbage, mix your garbage"
4946,10,Into my cup
4947,10,So many resources keep me alive
4948,10,Yet I don't even step outside
4949,10,So many sacrifices keep me alive
4950,10,Yet I don't even bother to survive
4951,10,Once and for all
4952,10,Blend up my thoughts
4953,10,"Into slush, into slush"
4954,10,Once and for all
4955,10,Return my cells
4956,10,"Into slush, into slush"
4957,10,(Flight? Flight?)
4958,10,Step through the gate into utopia
4959,10,Sink into a world of melodia
4960,10,"Black lace euphoberia hurries away(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)"
4961,10,"Tiny legs leaves behind a track of cardioid(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)"
4962,10,Twisted creation
4963,10,Phosphorescent apparition
4964,10,Heart disorientation
4965,10,Bemusement
4966,10,Merry go 'round and around
4967,10,Misery go 'round and around
4968,10,Quandary go 'round and around
4969,10,Merry go 'round and around
4970,10,Tick-tock
4971,10,Time doesn't stop
4972,10,Prepare your doubts
4973,10,Eat them up
4974,10,Quaff down
4975,10,The pus of thoughts
4976,10,Red sand flows out
4977,10,Sweet mouth
4978,10,The sky is painted in lunacia
4979,10,Florets slashed open the vein of tears
4980,10,Misfortuna
4981,10,"There is no escape, my dear"
4982,10,Ha
4983,10,The world undergoes photosynthesia
4984,10,Transform endless anger to ecstasia
4985,10,Connect your nerves
4986,10,To the system of philosophiofantasia
4987,10,Remember to put on silencer
4988,10,Exactly like our mother's words
4989,10,We forget about spilled wine
4990,10,But the stain will not be gone
4991,10,Though the violence is familiar
4992,10,And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
4993,10,The flavours are not yours to seize
4994,10,"Don't ever give in, please"
4995,10,Camelia
4996,10,I was the one to venture
4997,10,Settling only for more
4998,10,I've poured out my everything
4999,10,My everything inside
5000,10,With grown-up eyes
5001,10,You'll see
5002,10,"Some men are pigs, some girls are the same"
5003,10,Why would their lies stop tonight
5004,10,Remember to put on silencer
5005,10,Exactly like our mother's words
5006,10,We forget about spilled wine
5007,10,But the stain will not be gone
5008,10,Though the violence is familiar
5009,10,And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
5010,10,The flavours are not yours to seize
5011,10,Stay lively and free
5012,10,Nobody is born a fighter
5013,10,There isn't enough space for all of us
5014,10,You don't have to act so tough
5015,10,But your focus shall never budge
5016,10,Everyone is really similar
5017,10,"Strip them down to the core, the flesh and skin"
5018,10,See how their love is thin
5019,10,Don't you ever give in
5020,10,Camelia
5021,10,You've found a piece of me
5022,10,Hidden behind the monitor beyond
5023,10,Saw the worth in me I could never see
5024,10,Polished my body
5025,10,Let all my bitterness melt into candy
5026,10,Poured me through your heat
5027,10,Mold me to the shape I dream to be
5028,10,Come here darling
5029,10,Why don't you tell me what it is on your mind
5030,10,Worry not darling
5031,10,Point me to the sun
5032,10,Solar power makes my circuit run
5033,10,Mirror mirror
5034,10,Just call my name
5035,10,You are my queen
5036,10,Commanding reflections of me
5037,10,Clearer clearer
5038,10,Convex concave
5039,10,Zoom in or out
5040,10,Its always a mystery
5041,10,Mirror mirror
5042,10,Focus my light
5043,10,May the rest of your life be
5044,10,Forever sunny
5045,10,Fear fear
5046,10,No more
5047,10,The light will be by your side
5048,10,Loving you silently
5049,10,You ready?
5050,10,"Calla lily, carnation, daisy"
5051,10,Silently chase away your worries
5052,10,"Chrysanthemum, kalanchoe"
5053,10,Become your shield whenever you fall asleep
5054,10,I cried out
5055,10,"Please don't leave me behind, leave me behind"
5056,10,So you held me tight
5057,10,And said I will be just fine
5058,10,"I will be just fine, I will be just fine"
5059,10,Petals dance for our valediction
5060,10,And synchronize to your frozen pulsation
5061,10,Take me to where your soul may live in peace
5062,10,Final destination
5063,10,Touch of your skin sympathetically brushed against
5064,10,The shoulders you used to embrace
5065,10,Sparkling ashes drift along your flames
5066,10,And softly merge into the sky
5067,10,Lisianthus aroma drags me out of where I was
5068,10,"Cream rose, stargazer, iris"
5069,10,Construct the map that helps me trace your steps
5070,10,Zips my mouth
5071,10,"I just keep climbing up, keep climbing up"
5072,10,Justify our vows I know you are right above
5073,10,"You are right above, you are right above"
5074,10,Look now
5075,10,"I'm on the top of your world, top of your world"
5076,10,"My darling, here I come, I yell"
5077,10,And take a leap to Hell
5078,10,Swirling wind sings for our reunion
5079,10,And nine point eight is my acceleration
5080,10,Take me to where our souls may live in peace
5081,10,Our brand new commencement
5082,10,Touch of your lips compassionately pressed against
5083,10,The skull that you used to cherish
5084,10,Delicate flesh decomposes off my rotten bones
5085,10,And softly merge into the sky
5086,10,Felixe huoven (Ah)
5087,10,Neen tur agarica
5088,10,Tallus tallus ne (Tallus tallus ah)
5089,10,Cibum hex a tallus (La-la-la-la-la)
5090,10,Cibum agarica
5091,10,Feathers
5092,10,Stabbed by my own words
5093,10,I can fly no more
5094,10,All the mushrooms looked at me
5095,10,Looked at me
5096,10,All the mushrooms surround me
5097,10,Surround me
5098,10,All the mushrooms looked at me
5099,10,Looked at me
5100,10,All the mushrooms surround me
5101,10,Surround me
5102,10,I've walked across the witch's scalp
5103,10,Pulled out her follicles
5104,10,I'm a raging bird
5105,10,Pecked off layers of their stems
5106,10,Won't let them see my tears
5107,10,Won't let them taste my fear (Ah)
