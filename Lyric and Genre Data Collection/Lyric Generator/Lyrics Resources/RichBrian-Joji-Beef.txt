Topic: Beef 

Lyrics:
 
[Chorus]
I don't wanna beef, I just wanna see the faces of my enemies
When this is all over, I'm only gonna take their respect
I just wanna see their faces when they realize they've been defeated
When this is all over, I'm only gonna take their respect (Yeah)
I just wanna see their faces when they realize they've been defeated (Yeah)

[Verse ]
And I don't want a piece of you, no one does if you're not a threat (Yeah)
And we'll probably never meet 'cause you're not on my level (No)
I'ma end up on your top ten list, don't hold your breath'Cause this whole city's gettin' shook like that one time with Desiigner(Desiigner)
Even though it's childish how y'all takin' shots at me(Shots at me)
We all know that it's 'cause y'all don't have none of your own shit to talk about (About, about)
Half of y'all are broke as hell and need to stop rappin' about it (About it)
You wanna know how many shows I played without
