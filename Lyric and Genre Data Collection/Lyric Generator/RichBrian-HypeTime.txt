Lyrics:
 
[Chorus]
If I want the hype, I'll get the hype (Uh)
If I want the money, well, then I'ma get the money (Uh)
If I want a bad bitch then I'ma get a bad bitch (Uh)
I don't need your opinion 'cause this ain't about you (About you)
I was born in ' , but I'm living in ' now (Now)
You don't know me, bitch just follow what they own'Cause it's no time for your scumbag attitude
I'm so focused on where I'm going that my eyes are closed'Cause I don't need to see the road when I've rode it so many times(So many times)
When you ready for me then let me know (Let me know)
When you ready to drop then let me show (Show)
When you ready for this shit then let's go (Let's go)
Fuck what these niggas talk'Cause when they see us they know it's hype time(Hype time, hype time, hype time, hype time)
