[Verse ]
You left me here, I'm in the dark
I played your song, it reminded me of us
Now I'm reminiscing on the past
You said that you were leaving and I didn't react(I didn't react)
I trusted you like a fool with my young energy(Young energy)
You played me like a pro with your old tricks(Old tricks)
So why did I believe?(Why did I believe?)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Why?)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (What was it for?)
Ooh, oohl (I still wanna know what went through your mind)
Oohl (When you told me you were leaving and you wouldn't be back)
