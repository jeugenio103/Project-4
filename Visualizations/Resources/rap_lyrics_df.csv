  Dumbfoundead Waking up to instrumentals playing Smoke up in the ceiling fanComplicated wordplay but really I m a simple manI like my weather good I like my women hoodI keep it one hundred and get misunderstoodDon t get my words twisted now we ain t all the sameSome got a silver spoon others have a ball and chainSome wish you all the best some wish you all the painLife s a game and I m trying to make the hall of fameThis society asks you to pick a sideEvery minute of your life three hundred and sixty fiveRed or blue big or small yes or no right or wrongThe difference between the two is the feeling of I belongYeah we in the middle of all thisThe temperature s rising like the middle of AugustThey litter the airwaves you pick up the garbageBig dreams coming out this little apartment Hook Dumbfoundead All I know is keep it coolI stay calmThey ask me How you do that What is this fool on A little bit of this a little bit of thatIt s the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on trackAll I know is keep it coolI stay calmThey ask me How you do that What is this fool on A little bit of this a little bit of thatIt s the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track,Rap

 Intro Thane Maynard He has got inside he has climbed through the fence and has fallen about meters into the enclosure Debate now turning to whether or not the zoo authorities did the right thing in ordering a gorilla to be shot rather than tranquilizedI don t question why they felt it was a life threatening situation Chorus Dumbfoundead They tryna take me out like HarambeI take a tranquilizer on a MondayWhile the real ones we lost getting listed in the backWhile the fronting motherfuckers get the front pageThe world is a zoo you ve seen the newsYou ve seen them shoot at the youth The world is a zoo I ll see you pigs at the barbecueGod bless the red white and blue Harambe  Dumbfoundead Paranoia just to hit the cornerStarted getting cherry cola and a bag of chips what a bitchNeed a neighborhood watch for the gangs and the copsI ain t talkin bout the standards feel the burner on your neckWon t give you an attorney or a gurney to get checkedWe ll be lucky just to get to die an early deathThey might give me to life for murderin my setBroke boys everywhere like the government in debtWelcome to the jungle with more guns than rosesKeep from going under now don t push me overHold my composure four whiskey sodasI need that Irish no luck with clovers Hook Dumbfoundead They tryna take me out like HarambeI take a tranquilizer on a MondayWhile the real ones we lost getting listed in the backWhile the fronting motherfuckers get the front pageThe world is a zoo you ve seen the newsYou ve seen them shoot at the youth The world is a zoo I ll see you pigs at the barbecueGod bless the red white and blue Harambe  Dumbfoundead Who the fuck the plug Where the medicine man stay It s only o clock and already a bad dayNeed two bad bitches delivered to man caveOne man s soul is something you can t takeCall the repo man I m a people manBut the world don t treat you like an equal manI don t care if you CEO or pizza manWe just want a piece of mind and own a piece of landI don t want my future daughter askin Why they do him like that Why d they do that daddy The fuck I ma say Well baby the world gone mad Losin all the heroes like the Marlboro manSmoked all the leaves off the olive branchHow you stop a killer when the killer in the mirror and gorillaLike someone come and get ya lil mans Harambe,Rap

 st  She was from the other side of the train tracksA classic tale of Romeo Juliet played backI was from the city the inner partsShe was from the hills attending fancy dinner parties but stillWe managed to see each other I had a weekly bus passShe has a Mercedes C class and trust it was much fasterI am a rapper she is a classic pianistI sleep in boxers while she has a pair of fancy pajamasWhen we re together both our social status don t even matterWe should just go to Nevada get married and don t ever look backShe was the classiest sassy with a passion for fashion sense smashin on any of those nasty ass hoodratsUncomparable but only if her parents approvedMaybe they got something against asian american dudes just playinEither way I m sayin its just terrible newsCan t give you karats but can serenade you with tunesChorus Sam Ock You and me we are two stars from different galaxiesWill we cross or be aligned I guess that we ll see in time nd  I swig on ounces she sips on champagne she has a huge backyard I do the landscapinI get her single roses she gets me Laker ticketsCall her on my prepaid phone when I can t wait to kick itWe re quite the odd couple but who are you to judge I know it dont make sense you can call it stupid loveBut it s the whole world against usThey can try to stop us but we re going out like gangstas I know that I m hated by her campBut I swear this ll end like the lady and the trampI m just waiting for my chanceThey keep saying that shes way too good for meSometimes I wish sugar momma was sugar freeCause I ain t in it for the doughI ain t diggin for the goldI just wanna show all yall what both of us been knowinI don t want any problems or any of her dollasI just want yall to leave us alone and don t call usChorus Sam Ock You and me we are two stars from different galaxiesWill we cross or be aligned I guess that we ll see in timeYou and me we are two stars from different galaxiesWill we cross or be aligned I guess that we ll see in time,Rap
