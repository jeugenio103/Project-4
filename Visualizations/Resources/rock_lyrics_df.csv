 Timeless Inside of me I ll find you ,Rock
You taste like cigarettesI hit it every chance I getGirl you got me dripping sweatYou pull me back every time I quitYeah You taste like cigarettesYour body feels like disrespectLet you play me like an instrumentBut I m addicted to it yeahI m addicted to it yeah yeah I felt her coming and I couldn t escapeI m in the belly of the beast againMy dirty secret that keeps me awak Don t stop now you got me ready to Blow Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohOh oh oh oh oh oh ohOh oh oh oh oh oh oh  You taste lik cigarettesI got a problem think I m into itI breathe her in and hold it in my chestI take a hit and let it burn my lipsBurn my lips Hey I felt her coming and I couldn t escapeI m in the belly of the beast againMy dirty secret that keeps me awakeDon t stop now you got me ready to Blow Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohOh oh oh oh oh oh ohOh oh oh oh oh oh ohBlow,Rock
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh The walls are falling againI hear you calling my nameI want youYou re the match and the flameOxygen to the brain Yeah I want you You already knowThe way you turn it on you re so electricalCome on I come aliveYou start me up a million timesAnd I m terrifiedThat you could leave me crying Refrain Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Look I need you aroundGot my head in the cloudsCome overIt s a quarter past twoI m staying up for youJust to hold ya You already knowThe way you turn it on you re so electricalCome on,Rock
Lately I m so caught up in the momentI knowThere s so much in my head can t put it downI knowToo much on my chest shoulders tightGetting heavy turn on the light I need a little smoothing out the roughI want relief I want to feel your touchI want release a little something in the cutAh ah ah ah I came here to get some dopamineAh ah ah ah ah ah ah ahMake it go all night no gasolineAh ah ah ah ah ah ah ahYes I know you ve beenWaiting for me I need Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I need I need I came here to get some dopamine Dopamine Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I need I need I need dopamine I came here to Uh uh You telling me sweet nothingsGot me all rightAin t no time for talkingWhen we re tongue tiedHolding on my head close my eyesWhen it s raining you re my sunshine I need a little smoothing out the roughI want relief I want to feel your touchI want release Release a little something in the cutAh ah ah ah,Rock
I m coming back to youAnd I hope you don t mindThat I m wasting your timeI know you want me tooEven though you re not mineYou got that look in your eyes Come on tell me where you atWhen you re backI won t keep you up take a napA little gasoline and a match You just like it better when it s coldOh ohOh oh oh This ain t what you wantThis is what you needWake up in the morningKnow just what you need need need need I m coming back to youSo I really hope that you don t mindI know you want me tooEven though you re not mineYou got that look in your eyes Can you remember when I crossed it Put the sweat up in this like a mosh pitThink I m done up in thisDon t you stop meDon t wanna see you throw a fit You just like it better when it s coldOh ohOh oh ohOh ohOh oh oh,Rock
I m the same vibe different wavelengthsWrist bust down shorty got a plain JaneNow we at the crib playing Smash Bros MeleeOh she got that look got me singing like a Bubl Call the studio Dojo baby I m the teacher Austin Powers with the mojo it s my birthdayI mma need a cake I mma eat it like an entr eShe wants me to put a ring on it like Beyonc I can t leave you even if I tried toLate night when I slide throughCan leave you when it s time to When it s time I can t leave you even if I tried toLate night when I slide throughCan leave you when it s time to When it s time to Go ghostWhen it s time to When it s time to Go ghost Imma run through these hatersLike I m Hundred meter dash speedingDown on my own laneI m taking her to the crib with the cheesecakeBut I can t let go even if it was a mistakeCall the studio Dojo baby I m the teacher Austin Powers with the mojo it s my birthdayI mma need a cake I mma eat it like an entr eShe wants me to put a ring on it like Beyonc ,Rock
When I m broke and I m stressingI know you ll stay by meWhen I feel disconnectedYou re all I need When the water runs dryI know that I can always come find youYou re the only one that picks me upWhen I m so blueCan you feel it too When the sky is on fireI know that I can run wildWith youWhen the sky is on fireI know that I can run wildWith you Post Chorus When I m so blue When I m broke and I m stressingI know you ll stay by meWhen I feel disconnectedYou re all I need When the water runs dryI know that I can always come find youYou re the only one who picks me upWh n I m so blueAnd you feel it too When the sky is on fir I know that I can run wildWith youWhen the sky is on fireI know that I can run wildWith you,Rock
I fell for your magic I tasted your skinAnd though this is tragic at least I found the endI witnessed your madness you shed light on my sinsAnd if we share in this sadness then where have you been I know you re not in love like you used to beGuess I m not the one like you used to thinkSo you ll just runI know that I m stuck in this miseryGuess I m not enough like you used to thinkSo I ll just run Ooh You bathe in your victoryYou blew out on my fuseAnd if I took on the planetWill I pay my dues Your love was a mysteryYeah my love is a foolAnd I traveled the country just to get to you I know you re not in love like you used to beGuess I m not the one like you used to thinkSo you ll just runI know that I m stuck in this miseryGuess I m not enough like you used to thinkSo I ll just run And I traveled the countryAnd I traveled the country just to get to youI know you re not in loveI know you re not in loveI know you re not in love,Rock
