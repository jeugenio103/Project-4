# Project #4
> Project 4 will go through music features that Spotify API provides to visualize the differences within different genres. Incorporate machine learning to train our model to filter through lyrics and identify what genre the lyrics/song is from. Create a lyric generator by putting a word/ genre in and having the generator produce lyrics through the training model.<br><br>
	
ETL:<br>
Query specific genre playlists from spotify<br>
Curate genre, lyrics, meta-data from artists into DF<br>
Load data to a aws/google database to query for ML<br>
<br><br>
ML Features:<br> 
Allow users to input keywords and select a genre to develop their own 88Rising song lyrics using our saved machine learning model<br><br>

## General Information



## Features
List the ready features here:
- Genre Predictor
- Lyric Generator

## Genre Predictor
We created a Genre Predictor using a Machine Learning Model, Spotify API, and by web scraping the Genius Lyrics website. We created the initial dataframe from the audio features taken by Spotify API and list of genres from web scraping the Genius website. Then we scaled the data and used a SVC Model in order to predict what genre a song would be based on its audio features. The 5 genres we chose to focus on were Pop, R&B, Rock, Country, and Rap. We were able to get about 60% accuracy.

The way the Genre Predictor works is that we input a song in the search bar, it pulls data from the Spotify API to obtain the audio features, then the audio features are used to predict the genre of the song using the model.

Because this is based on audio features, it does have difficulty predicting songs that wouldnâ€™t normally fit in the 5 main genres such as EDM or more Indie Music and also it would have difficulty with songs that have audio feature levels not normally associated with their specific genre. Also, since genres are a bit subjective it would also affect our model. Overall, we could improve our accuracy by utilizing a larger dataset 

## Music Features
As shown, we successfully scraped over 10,000 mainstream song features, but we noticed a skewed distribution when analyzing the genre count within our mainstream artist dataset. Pop was a high outlier, with 5,000 songs compared to the maximum count of other genres. 

When comparing this to our 88 Rising data, we observed that Pop and Rap were the leading genres amongst 88rising artist.

The main features with higher prominent values  were danceability, energy, mode, and valence. These were highly indicative in equalizing our data set, as well as  transforming our training values by dropping unnecessary features like duration. As this made a factor in our genre classification.

Music tempo values ranged between 117 and 125, thus, there was no clear correlation between mainstream and 88Rising music data when testing our model.

On average, mainstream music had lower compressed and adjusted loudness compared to 88Rising genre style music. However, under Spotify interface, spotify does standardize loudness to not exceed -1 or -2 dB to avoid distortion and transcoding issues for track feature analysis. 

Our last images are word clouds with the most frequent word usage per genre. Most of the words can be categorized as filler words, but we can see how certain words are dominant for specific genres, such as love and profanity for Pop and Rap.
