# Project #4
> Project 4 will go through music features that Spotify API provides to visualize the differences within different genres. Incorporate machine learning to train our model to filter through lyrics and identify what genre the lyrics/song is from. Create a lyric generator by putting a word/ genre in and having the generator produce lyrics through the training model.<br><br>
	
ETL:<br>
Query specific genre playlists from spotify<br>
Curate genre, lyrics, meta-data from artists into DF<br>
Load data to a aws/google database to query for ML<br>
<br><br>
ML Features:<br> 
Allow users to input keywords and select a genre to develop their own 88Rising song lyrics using our saved machine learning model<br><br>

Data Retrieval:<br>
Scrape Genius lyrics 88rising songs we have listed from project 3.<br>
Spotify API - Draw music features to visualize and to also possibly create music based on a designated genre.<br>
